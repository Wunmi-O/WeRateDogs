    "The task at hand was to wrangle the WeRateDogs tweets from 3 different sources. I started out by gathering the dataset from the various sources- csv, json.txt and tsv files. I leveraged pandas, requests and json libraries to ensure that all 3 datasets were porperly loaded in order to start assessing the dataset to identify certain quality and tidiness issues using both visual and programmatic assessment. \n",
